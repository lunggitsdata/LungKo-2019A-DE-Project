# Stock Trading with Apache Kafka Streams
## Introduction
This project implements a Kafka Streams pipeline that processes a stock ticker stream to initiate buy or sell actions.

## Motivation
Apache Kafka has grown in popularity over the past few years and has been widely adopted by many businesses. While it started out as a log messaging system, Kafka has grown to encompass more functionality, including the addition of Kafka Streams. Implementing a stream processing pipeline entirely in Kafka without adding technology overhead such as Apache Spark or Apache Storm presents itself as an attractive option.

## Tools and Technologies Used
1. Apache Kafka (Streams DSL, Connect)
2. S3
3. Python
4. Flask
5. PostgreSQL
